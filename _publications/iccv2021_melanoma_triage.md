excerpt: "Introduces a dermatopathologist-supervised deep learning system that triages melanoma specimens by prioritizing the highest risk whole-slide images."
---

We present a pathology triage pipeline that leverages dermatopathologist consensus labels to train a deep neural network for melanoma risk assessment. The system prioritizes suspicious cases for review, reducing the burden on experts while maintaining diagnostic quality across large cohorts of digitized slides.
