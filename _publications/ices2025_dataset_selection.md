excerpt: "Benchmarks how different pre-training datasets impact fish detection accuracy in challenging underwater video."
---

We compare pre-training sources covering diverse marine environments and camera setups to quantify their downstream effect on fish detection. The work underscores the importance of matching pre-training domain statistics with deployment scenarios to reduce annotation demands offshore.
