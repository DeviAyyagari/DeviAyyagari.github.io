We outline a practical framework for tracking marine ecosystems using low-cost underwater cameras and deep learning models. By coupling lightweight hardware with semi-automated annotation workflows, the study highlights a path toward persistent habitat monitoring and timely biodiversity insights that can guide conservation decisions.
