excerpt: "Demonstrates a weakly supervised model that flags malignant melanocytic lesions from slide-level labels alone."
---

The study applies multiple instance learning and attention pooling to whole-slide images of melanocytic lesions, highlighting how weak supervision can still drive accurate malignancy detection. The workflow provides earlier warnings for dysplastic or malignant cases prior to manual review.
