Welcome! My name is Kameswari Devi Ayyagari. I am interested in studying and leveraging machine learning algorithms to advance biology, medicine and healthcare. The best way to reach me is by email at *akdevi.92 AT gmail*.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science and bioinformatics. I believe that efficient machine learning, statistical and data analysis tools have the power to augment the abilities of medical practitioners in early detection of different medical conditions, resulting in better and timely healthcare options. Through my graduate studies in Computer Science, I intend to leverage machine learning algorithms to advance healthcare. 

I believe that building trust in deep learning systems with medical practitioners is the cornerstone for widespread and sustainable integration of deep learning in the next generation of healthcare applications. To that end, I am interested in pushing the frontiers of explainable AI a little bit further, by developing highly interpretable and explainable AI algorithms. I am also interested in algorithmic fairness and bias and would like to design healthy machine learning models that contribute towards mitigating the impending ethical threat the bias within health data poses to the use of machine learning in medicine.
